What i have done so far to orchestrate the application using minikube kubernetes distribution and docker container.
1) Installed Oracle VM VirtualBox 6.0.2 on my windows 7 operating system by following the link below.
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads - Clieck on Windows Hosts to trigger the installation.
2)Installed and set the PATH to Chocolatey Package manager by running the below command from windows comman prompt as admin
@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
3)Issue Choco -? to check the installation
4)Installed the kubectl command line to talk to minikube master
1.Run the installation command
  choco install kubernetes-cli  
2.Test to ensure the version you installed is sufficiently up-to-date:
  kubectl version
 3. Instal MiniKube by issuing the following command
 choco install minikube kubernetes-cli
 4.Start minikube
   minikube start
  Pictures of Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager running minikue are added to the folder \Kubernetes
 5.Check the cluster info with below command
 kubectl cluster-info dump
 6.To stop the minikube
 minikube stop
 7. to retrieve the IP addres
 minikube ip
 8.To access the dashboard
 minikube dashboard

 10.Access Dashboard using the kubectl command-line tool by running the following command:
